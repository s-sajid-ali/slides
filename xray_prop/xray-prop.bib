abstract = {Abstract Diffraction effects may limit the spatial resolution and fidelity of soft X-ray lithography and contact microradiography, by scattering during transmission of X rays through a finite-thickness object, and in subsequent propagation to the image-recording plane. A numerical method is described to model such soft X-ray scattering effects, developed from the multislice method for electron diffraction calculations. Computer simulations are presented of scattering by sub-micron latex spheres used as test objects in contact microradiography, and carbon-like gratings used as lithographic masks. The calculated diffraction by spheres is shown to be consistent with experimental results and a rigorous Mie scattering calculation, and the calculations for gratings suggest the possibility of frequency-doubling lithography under carefully controlled conditions.},

abstract = {Numerical examples of time-dependent FEL wavefront propagation calculation and coherence analysis are presented. The calculations are performed using the Synchrotron Radiation Workshop (SRW)-wave-optics computer code optimized for synchrotron radiation, and the 3D FEL simulation code GENESIS 1.3. In the examples described, the electric field obtained at the exit of an FEL undulator after running GENESIS in time-dependent mode is transformed from time to frequency domain, and then propagated, using Fourier-optics methods implemented in SRW, through interferometer-type optical schemes. Time-averaged intensity patterns, obtained in image planes of the interferometers as a result of these simulations, allow for straightforward coherence characterization by visibility of interference fringes. The presented examples show that Fourier optics-based wavefront propagation method, as implemented in the SRW, can be effectively used for detailed analysis of characteristics of FEL radiation in time and in frequency domains. Besides, due to its high accuracy and CPU-efficiency, this method is very well suited for optimization of optical beamlines for fourth generation synchrotron radiation sources, for which accurate treatment of wave-optical phenomena, aimed to preserve radiation coherence and time structure, is of paramount importance. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Accurate simulation of scalar optical diffraction requires consideration of the sampling requirement for the phase chirp function that appears in the Fresnel diffraction expression. We describe three sampling regimes for FFT-based propagation approaches: ideally sampled, oversampled, and undersampled. Ideal sampling, where the chirp and its FFT both have values that match analytic chirp expressions, usually provides the most accurate results but can be difficult to realize in practical simulations. Under- or oversampling leads to a reduction in the available source plane support size, the available source bandwidth, or the available observation support size, depending on the approach and simulation scenario. We discuss three Fresnel propagation approaches: the impulse response/transfer function (angular spectrum) method, the single FFT (direct) method, and the two-step method. With illustrations and simulation examples we show the form of the sampled chirp functions and their discrete transforms, common relationships between the three methods under ideal sampling conditions, and define conditions and consequences to be considered when using nonideal sampling. The analysis is extended to describe the sampling limitations for the more exact Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction solution.},

All elements of the beamline - insertion device, mirrors, variable-line-spacing gratings and slits - are included in the simulations. Radiation intensity distributions at the sample position are displayed for representative photon energies in the UV range (20 - 100 eV) where diffraction effects are strong. The finite acceptance of the refocusing mirrors is the dominating factor limiting the spatial resolution at the sample (by similar to 3 mu m at 20 eV). Absolute estimates of the radiation flux and energy resolution at the sample are also obtained from the electromagnetic calculations. The analysis of the propagated UV range undulator radiation at different deflection parameter values demonstrates that within the beamline angular acceptance a slightly "red-shifted" radiation provides higher flux at the sample and better energy resolution compared to the on-axis resonant radiation of the fundamental harmonic.},
