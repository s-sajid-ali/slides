abstract = {We present a formalism of x-ray dynamical diffraction from volume diffractive optics with large numerical aperture and high aspect ratio, in an analogy to the Takagi-Taupin equations for strained single crystals. We derive a set of basic equations for dynamical diffraction from volume diffractive optics, which enable us to study the focusing property of these optics with various grating profiles. We study volume diffractive optics that satisfy the Bragg condition to various degrees, namely flat, tilted and wedged geometries, and derive the curved geometries required for ultimate focusing. We show that the curved geometries satisfy the Bragg condition everywhere and phase requirement for point focusing, and effectively focus hard x-rays to a scale close to the wavelength.},

abstract = {Fresnel zone plates are the key optical elements for nanoscale focusing of X-ray beams with high spatial resolution. Conventional zone plates manufactured by planar nanotechnology processes are limited by the achievable aspect ratios of their zone structures. Additionally, ultra-high resolution X-ray optics with high efficiency requires three-dimensional (3-D) shaped tilted zones. The combination of high spatial resolution and high diffraction efficiency is a fundamental problem in X-ray optics. Based on electrodynamical simulations, we find that the optimized zone plate profile for volume diffraction is given by zone structures with radially increasing tilt angles and decreasing zone heights. On-chip stacking permits the realization of such advanced 3-D profiles without significant loss of the maximum theoretical efficiency. We developed triple layer on-chip stacked zone plates with an overlay accuracy of sub-2 nm which fulfills the nanofabrication requirements. Efficiency measurements of on-chip stacked zone plates show significantly increased values compared to conventional zone plates.},

The diffractive elements are generated by electron beam lithography and chemical wet etching of {\textless}110{\textgreater} oriented silicon substrates. By tilting the cylindrical lenses with respect to the x-ray beam, the effective path through the phase shifting zones can be varied. This makes it possible to optimize the diffraction efficiency over a wide range of photon energies, and to obtain effective aspect ratios not accessible with untilted optics. The diffraction efficiency of such a lens was measured as a function of the tilt angles for various energies between 8 and 29 keV. Values close to the theoretical limit were obtained for all energies. Because of the coherence preserving properties of diffractive optics, the method opens up opportunities for experiments using coherent hard x rays.},

abstract = {A new type of Fresnel zone plate has been constructed which can focus ultraviolet radiation of any wavelength down to the soft x-ray region. It consists of a set of thin circular gold bands made self supporting by radial struts, leaving the transparent zones empty. Experimental tests at 6700, 4358, and 2537 A showed that the theoretical minimum angular resolution obeys the Rayleigh criterion, sin$\theta$min = 1.22$\lambda$/D. The diameter of the zone plate is D=0.26 cm and contains 19 opaque zones, the narrowest of which measured about 20 µ across. The zone plate was better than the optimum pinhole in resolution by a factor of about 6 and in speed by a factor of 40. The zone plate produced pictures that compared favorably with those made with a lens of similar focal length and aperture. The lens was about 20 times faster than the zone plate at 4358 A, but at 1000 A the zone plate would have been far faster than the lens. Focusing tests are contemplated at 1000 A and at 100 A where lenses and mirrors, the conventional image-forming devices, may fail. The angular resolution at 2537 A was close to the theoretical value of 1.2×10−4 rad and held over a field of at least 1.75×10−2 rad, which is 2.0 times the angle subtended by the sun's disk at the earth. A zone plate telescope, operating in the soft x-ray or extreme ultraviolet region, far above the earth's atmosphere in an orbiting satellite, now seems possible.},

The change of the diffraction behavior from the Raman-Nath regime in the center of the zone plate to the Bragg regime towards its edge is discussed. Due to increasing sensitivity to deviations from the Bragg condition with increasing optical thickness, satisfaction of the Bragg condition is shown to be the most critical demand for achieving high diffraction efficiencies. Basic equations that describe the diffraction by a zone plate of arbitrary aspect ratio are presented. Numerical results for high resolution zone plates with a sinusoidal grating profile are discussed, considering pure phase gratings as well as zone plates built with an absorbing material. Calculations both for Bragg and off-Bragg devices are given. The decrease of the local diffraction efficiency due to deviations from the Bragg condition is shown, as well as an increase that occurs if the zones are tilted toward the optical axis. The influence of absorption in the grating on the diffraction efficiency is discussed. ?? 1992.},

In transmission, the two Fresnel zone plates on the two sides of the substrate will act as a single zone plate with added structure height. The presented double-sided zone plates with 30 nm smallest zone width offer up to 9.9{\%} focusing efficiency at 9 keV, that results in a factor of two improvement over their previously demonstrated single-sided counterparts.

abstract = {Fresnel zone plates produced by electron beam lithography and planar etching techniques provide a resolving power of about 10 nm. An alternative zone plate fabrication approach is based on alternately coating a micro-wire with two different materials. With this process, very thin zone layers with very high aspect ratios can be deposited. However, depending on the fabrication method, random zone positioning errors may introduce strong aberrations. We simulate the effect of positioning errors using different random fluctuations and study their influence on zone plate resolution. We find that random errors significantly decrease the contrast transfer of X-ray microscopes. Additionally, we derive an upper bound for the mean acceptable variance of the deposition rate.},

The use of the zone plate for focusing transmitted wavelengths ranging from the infrared to the very soft X-ray region is discussed. An investigation is made of the focal and chromatic properties of a zone plate to be used for visible and near ultraviolet light. Photographs of several lines of the Hg spectrum made by using a zone plate as the focusing "lens" are exhibited. The similiarity between the optical properties of a transmission zone plate and a converging lens are shown by both theoretical considerations and experiment.},

	abstract = {When calculating the focusing properties of cylindrically symmetric focusing optics, numerical wave propagation calculations can be carried out using the quasi-discrete Hankel transform (QDHT). We describe here an imple- mentation of the QDHT where a partial transform matrix can be stored to speed up repeated wave propagations over specified distances, with reduced computational memory requirements. The accuracy of the approach is then verified by comparison with analytical results, over propagation distances with both small and large Fresnel numbers. We then demonstrate the utility of this approach for calculating the focusing properties of Fresnel zone plate optics that are commonly used for x-ray imaging applications and point to future applications of this approach. {\textcopyright}},

This approach produces results indistinguishable from methods such as coupled wave theory, and it allows one to reproduce other X-ray optical phenomena such as grazing incidence reflectivity where the direction of energy flow is changed significantly. Just as finite element analysis methods allow engineers to compute the thermal and mechanical responses of arbitrary structures too complex to model by analytical approaches, multislice propagation can be used to understand the properties of the real-world optics of finite extent and with local imperfections, allowing one to better understand the limits to nanoscale X-ray imaging.},
